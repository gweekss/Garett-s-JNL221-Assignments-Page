			<p> Syracuse University is a private University that has many different ways of life and history surrounding it. Towards the west there are disenfranchised communities that continue to deal with issues such as lead poisoning and towards the East are suburbs that have been a primary reason for white flight. In both of these communities however, there could very easily be issues of drug abuse.</p>

			<h3>The Issue of Drug Abuse</h3>
			<p>Drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the past couple of years. With almost every category of drug producing multiple times the deaths as in the late 1990s to 2010s. This presents a clear issue as with the incorporation of technology, and although many depictions of drugs are bad and influence people not to take them. The visualization of people our age taking different drugs to party or casually influences many other college aged students to believe that they can take these drugs as well and be fine. </p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>On average, from 1999 to 2020, 25,660 people die from opioid overdose. In the past 5 years, 57,647 people die on average from opioid overdose. These types of statistics are present in every category of drug; heroin increasing from 6,489 to 17,224 deaths per year, cocaine increasing from 7,310 to 16,220 average deaths per year, psychostimulants increasing from 4,702 to 15,255 deaths per year, and methadone increasing from 3,477 to 3,835 deaths per year in the past 5 years. These drastic almost doubling or tripling in each category of drug deaths besides methadone provides evidence that drug use as a whole has increased drastically. The amount of deaths that have occurred in the past 5 years directly due to drug use has a direct correlation of immense growth of the drug community and the abuse of the drugs leading to an extreme amount of deaths. </p>
