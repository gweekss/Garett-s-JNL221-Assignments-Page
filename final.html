			<p> The recent rise in drug overdose deaths is evident. Event with small decreases to drugs such as heroin, methadone, and natural opioids they aren't a drastic enough change to combat the drastic rise of opioids, synthetic opioids, cocaine or psychostimulants with abuse potential deaths. <br></br>In 2021, 220 people died each day from an opioid overdose according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/epidemic.html">CDC</a>. There has been a lot done to combat the epidemic, however the rates have jumped during the COVID-19 pandemic and aren't decreasing much since.</p>

			<h3>The Issue of Drug Abuse</h3>
			<p>Drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the past couple of years. With almost every category of drug producing multiple times the deaths as in the late 1990s to 2010s. This presents a clear issue as with the pandemic accelerating the death toll and that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html"> CDC</a> states that, "people who have had at least one overdose are more likely to have another." <br></br>This issue is highlighted with the amount of deaths in the past five years, in fact, since 1999 there have been 1,572,881 drug overdose deaths. Since 2018 there has been 853,311 deaths. Over half of all recorded drug overdose deaths have occurred in the past 5 years. </p>

			<h3>What is Being Done to Combat the Drug Epidemic?</h3>
			<p>On average in the past 5 years, 87,285 people die from a drug overdose. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/overdose-prevention/"> HHS</a> has four crucial steps to help prevent more overdose deaths. The first is primary prevention, where pharmeaceuticals have to practice safe prescriptioning, and raising awareness of the dangers and risks of using over the counter opioids and risks of other drugs. <br></br>Harm reduction is keeping people who are using drugs alive and as healthy as possible. Which is reducing the negative effects and stigma of substance use to include harm reduction services into general medical care with different services to give people resources to find help. 
				<br></br>There's evidence-based treatment, where if a person is ready to quit their substance abuse, there will be high-quality treatment available and ready. This step focuses on improving access to treatments. <br></br>Their fourth step is recovery support, where former substance abusers can get together and talk like Alcholics Anonymous, or having service teams in higher risk areas where they are needed to ensure that people have the resources that are needed to get through their substance abuse problems. <br></br>The HHS also provides research that Canada and the United States are doing together through the Substance Use and Harms During COVID-19 and Approaches to Federal Surveillance and Response white papers, which monitors trends of substance abuse. The main topics of research by the two countries are, "substance use harms and deaths in Canada and the U.S. The impact of COVID-19 on the opioids crisis, policy responses to address substance use from the outset of COVID-19 pandemic to September 2022."</p>

			<h4> Who is This Affecting? </h4>
			<p> In 2019 and 2020, people aged 25-44 had the most drug overdose deaths. This trend is stil evident with people aged 35 to 44 experiencing the most opioid overdose deaths with 20,137 in 2021 according to the <a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/drugoverdoses/#:~:text=The%2035%2D%20to%2044%2Dyear,and%20older%20is%20growing%20rapidly.">nsc </a> with 71% of preventable opioid deaths occuring from people aged 25 to 54. <br></br>The article also states that women overdose deaths have increased at a quicker pace of 1,608% to 1,076% for men. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm#:~:text=System%2C%20Mortality%20File.-,Non%2DHispanic%20American%20Indian%20or%20Alaska%20Native%20people%20had%20the,origin%20groups%20(Figure%203)."> CDC  </a> in 2021 and 2021 Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Natives disproportionately had more deaths than any other race with 42.5 per 100,000 in 2020 and 56.6 in 2021. African Americans and White people followed with 35.8 in 2020 and 44.2 in 2021 for African Americans and 33.1 and 36.8 for White people. These figures can help show which people are being affected by the drug overdose epidemic. 
			<br></br>The CDC also reported on which states increased or decreased in drug overdose deaths from July 2022 to July 2023. The states with the most increase were Washington with a 38.5% increase, Oregon with a 27.8% increase, Nevada with a 24.4% increase, followed by Washington D.C. with 14%, Alaska and Wyoming with 13%. <br></br>All of these figures combined help show where and to who the previously mentioned resources to stop the drug overdose epidemic can be most utilized and where help is the most needed. Although it wouldn't stop the drug epidemic, it could help slow down the amount of deaths that are being caused across the United States. </p>

			<h5>What's Next?</h5>
			<p> Advocacy. The only way that <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/overdose-epidemic/advocacy-action-ending-overdose-epidemic">the AMA </a> believes that the drug epidemic will slow down would be to advocate for ways to combat it. Making naloxone, an overdose reversing medication that can save lives, more accessible instead of needing a prescription. Adopting harm-reduction measures such as decriminalizing fentanyl test strips, removing barriers to evidence-based care for people that use these drugs to get help is one of the first massive steps according to the AMA. <br></br>This can only be done with the state and federal governments decisions to decriminalize testing strips for people to get help. Increasing public health treatments such as access to more mental health treatment, removing regulations,increasing benefits for pharmacy managers and finding ways to collect this data in a timely, accurate, standardized way to find at-risk populations are all ways to start solving this issue according to the AMA.
